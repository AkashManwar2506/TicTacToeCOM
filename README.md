## Tic Tac Toe (React + TypeScript)

A beautifully crafted Tic‚ÄëTac‚ÄëToe game you can play locally with a friend or against a smart computer opponent. It features a glassy dark UI, subtle animations, a scoreboard, winning‚Äëline highlights, and multiple AI difficulties.

### Features
- **Polished UI**: Modern glassmorphism design, responsive layout, Inter/Poppins fonts.
- **Two Modes**: Two‚Äëplayer local play or **Vs Computer**.
- **AI Difficulty**: Easy (random), Medium (win/block + heuristics), Impossible (unbeatable minimax).
- **Flexible Sides**: Choose whether the computer plays as X or O.
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks X wins, O wins, and draws across rounds.
- **Quality of Life**: Winning-line highlight, round reset, and new match.
